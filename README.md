# MonocleEngineDemo
A working project made using MonocleEngine by Maddy Thorson (the creator of Celeste and TowerFall) and MonoGame, covering basing things.

This project contains the project, MonocleEngine (https://github.com/shortgecko/MonocleEngineMirror) source and a built version of Cevyray's Crunch project (https://github.com/chevyray/crunch), along with some sprites for demonstration purposes.
