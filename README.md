# MonocleEngineDemo
A working project made using MonocleEngine by Matt Thorson and MonoGame, covering basing things.

This project contains the project, MonocleEngine (https://bitbucket.org/MattThorson/monocle-engine/src/default/) source and a built version of Cevyray's Crunch project (https://github.com/chevyray/crunch), along with some sprites for demonstration purposes.

It contains two scenes, entities, loading atlases from generated xml crunch files, creating a spritebank and using it inside entities, basic collisions, camera adjustments and object movement using MInput.
