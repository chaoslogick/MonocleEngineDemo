Notes regarding the Sprites.xml file used for creating a SpriteBank.

Inside the 'Sprites' tag add all different sprites that you want to use.
Each of them can be used, for instance, for a different entity.
Each sprite has a 'path' attribute that represents the location or
folder inside the Atlas that we are accessing from a SpriteBank. That
attribute should be only the path represented by folders (not files).
Optionally, you can select a start animation for a sprite using the
'start' attribute (which is recommended) and naming the animation id.

Inside the sprite there are several types of tags.
With the <Center/> tag, you can specify the sprite origin being in the
center of the sprite.
With the <Justify x="1" y="1" /> tag, you can set a specific point of
the sprite origin, tuning the x and y attributes in the range between
0 and 1 ( where (0,0) is the top-left and (1,1) is the bottom-right position).
There are two main types of tags that define the type of sprite:
<Loop> and <Anim> tags.
When a sprite has a <Loop> tag, it means that once the sprite animation
has finished, it will start over. Unlike that, the <Anim> tag defines that
the sprite animation when done remains as the last frame.
Both, the <Loop> and <Anim> tag, have an 'id' attribute which is the name of
that type of animation referenced by the sprite (like in the start attribute
of the sprite tag). The 'path' attribute represents the name of the file
located inside the sprite path. If the file is an animation consisting of
multiple frames, you can enter the name of the file ommiting the number of
the frame in the file name (for example, we have an animation of 8 frames,
where each frame has the name like 'arrow0', 'arrow1', 'arrow2' and so on. We
can just say path="arrow"). In case of multiple frames per animation, we can
also specify which frames at which order are the part of our animation, using
the frames attribute (for example: frames="0-7,9-10,2-4,15" will make an animation
going through the first seven frames, then skipping the eight and going from ninth
to tenth, then going from the second to the fourth and finally fifteenth frame of a file).
Instead of repeating a value several times just to make the animation, for example, frozen,
we can say frames="0*10", which means that it will repeat the frame with index 0 ten times.
If we assign this to an object, we will notice that the animation will go in an instant.
We can set the speed of the animation (in seconds) using the 'delay' attribute. The delay
will be set between each two frames we set in the 'frames' attribute.
Once the animation of the <Anim> type was finished, we can change to another animation inside
the sprite using the 'goto' attribute and naming the id of the animation. You can also chain
multiple animations and once the current animation is over, it will execute them in the entered
order, starting from left to right. Additionally, you can also set the number of repeatings for
each of the provided animations using the format "idOfAnimation:numberOfRepeats" (for example:
goto="idle:10,sleep:6,wakeUp").

example:

<player path="playerAnimations/" start="idle">
    <Center/>
    <Anim id="idle" path="player_idle" delay="1" goto="move:5,sleep"/>
    <Anim id="move" path="player_move_right" frames="1-3" delay="0.5" goto="idle"/>
    <Loop id="sleep" path="player_sleep" frames="0*3,5-7,3,12-13" delay="0.2"/>
 </player>
